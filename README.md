# Codewars-Challenge
Uploads of some Kata solutions I wrote and tested on Codewars.com

Sometimes in my free time I work on Codewars.com Challenges (or Kata) that go from 4 to 1 Kyu difficulty (they are labeled from 8 to 1, with 8 as the easiest and 1 as the hardest).

These solutions aren't the best as you could possibly imagine, but are the best I've done. They have all passed the test for the submitting, so I pressuposed they are correct (but isn't confirmed for all the limit cases!).
