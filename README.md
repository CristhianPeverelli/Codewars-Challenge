# Codewars-Challenge
Uploads of some Kata solutions I wrote and tested on [codewars.com](www.codewars.com), down here you can check my profile!

## What is Codewars?
Its a site where creative users can publish coding puzzles/challenges and you can try to solve them by choosing your favorite language/s, writing down you program, and testing it with the site's input. The higher are the challenges you complete, the higher is the score you will get! 

## Why I train on Codewars?
I train on it because the challenges are various, in large amounts and the inputs always stress your program to check if you solution is optimized and not bruteforced. Another awesome feature you can choose between 8 different difficulties (see below) so you can prove you strenght in a specific language, or you can start learning a new one.

### Extra
My solutions aren't the best as you could possibly imagine, but are the best I've done. They have all passed the test for the submitting, so I suppose they are correct (but this isn't confirmed for all the limit cases you can image!).
If you want to read the specifics of every program, just type the class title into Codewars.com and you will find the original challenge.
